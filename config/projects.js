My primary responsibilities focused on solution design, AWS management and deployment, development pipeline automation, formulating security baselines, writing product documentation, and vendor orchestration.
<br/>
<br/>
One of my primary roles was to design and develop the technical solution for the Reading Reimagined platform RFPs. This involved working closely with other members of the team to understand the specific requirements of the platform and then designing a solution that would meet those needs.
<br/>
<br/>
I utilized my experience with AWS management and deployment to ensure that the platform would be scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to designing the technical solution, I also played a key role in automating the development pipeline. This included developing scripts and tools to automate the build, test, and deployment process, which allowed the team to iterate quickly and efficiently.
<br/>
<br/>
Another critical aspect of my role was to ensure that the platform met the highest standards for security. This involved formulating security baselines, conducting security audits and assessments, and implementing industry-standard security measures.
<br/>
<br/>
As part of my responsibilities, I also wrote comprehensive product documentation, which included user guides, technical documentation, and training materials. This documentation was essential in ensuring that all stakeholders had a clear understanding of the platform's functionality and how to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I was responsible for orchestrating vendors and managing relationships with third-party suppliers. This involved negotiating contracts, managing vendor performance, and ensuring that all vendors were aligned with the project's goals and objectives.`,

    desc: `I had the privilege of working with Aeyde, a high-end shoe company based in Berlin. My role involved configuring their Shopify Plus store and designing a cloud-native "Back In Stock" service that allowed customers to enroll in product-specific waitlists and be notified when items were back in stock. This project involved several technologies, including AWS, Typescript, the storefront API, data analytics tools such as Looker and Panoply, and a Shopify app.
<br/>
<br/>
The project started with customizations of the Shopify Plus store, which included theme and navigation revisions. I worked with the client to ensure that their store met their business requirements and provided a seamless customer experience.
<br/>
<br/>
Next, I designed the "Back In Stock" service, which was a custom solution that allowed customers to enroll in waitlists for specific products and receive notifications when the products were back in stock. The service was built using cloud-native technologies, including AWS and Typescript, and integrated with the storefront API to manage customer waitlist enrollments and notifications.
<br/>
<br/>
To provide analytics on customer behavior and inventory management, I integrated the service data analytics tools such as Looker and Panoply. This allowed the client to monitor customer waitlist enrollments, track inventory levels, and make data-driven decisions.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I developed a companion Typescript app that integrated with the "Back In Stock" service, providing a seamless experience for customers to enroll in waitlists directly from the Shopify store. The app also allowed the client to manage waitlist enrollments and notifications through the Shopify admin panel.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, working with Aeyde was an exciting project that challenged me to apply my Shopify development skills to build a cloud-native solution that met the client's business requirements while providing an excellent customer experience. The project allowed me to showcase my expertise in Shopify Plus store configuration and complete solution design of a cloud-native service. Reviving the broken system and creating a future-proof solution was a rewarding experience.`,

As the lead developer, I was personally responsible for the infrastructure planning, full-stack development, and DevOps of the application. This project was particularly challenging as it required me to apply my cloud engineering skills in a globally distributed environment, using Microsoft Azure.
<br/>
<br/>
As the infrastructure planning lead, I had to make decisions on the cloud architecture, selecting appropriate services, and configuring the virtual machines, network, and storage. I had to ensure that the application was designed with scalability, availability, and performance in mind, and that it was optimized for cost-effectiveness.
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of full-stack development, I had to work on building the front-end, back-end, and database layers of the application. I collaborated with the product manager to ensure that the application met the business requirements, and that it was user-friendly and intuitive.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, as the DevOps lead, I had to ensure that the application was built using best practices, including continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, automated testing, and monitoring. I had to ensure that the application was secure, using appropriate security baselines, including access controls, encryption, and network security.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the Halotrade project challenged me to apply my cloud engineering skills to build an enterprise-grade application that met the business requirements while optimizing for cost and performance.

To further enhance the customer experience, I leveraged the cloud to develop a custom hosted video solution. This solution allowed Emkfit to create and host her own video content, providing her customers with an immersive fitness experience. The solution was seamlessly integrated into the Shopify store, making it easy for customers to access and view the content.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the custom hosted video solution, I used Klaviyo for marketing campaigns and extended analytics. Klaviyo is a powerful marketing platform that helped Emkfit to create and execute targeted marketing campaigns. The extended analytics provided by Klaviyo allowed Emkfit to track the effectiveness of her marketing campaigns, helping her to make data-driven decisions to improve her business.

The challenge for the client was the inefficiency caused by in-person cash transactions, which slowed down their business. The solution I designed and developed enabled customers to book and pay instantly online, eliminating the need for in-person transactions. This streamlined their daily operations and made it easier for customers to book sessions, saving time for both the client and their customers.
<br/>
<br/>
The online booking service I developed included unique logic for "no shows" and customer cancellations, which helped the client to manage their bookings efficiently. Additionally, the integration of the online booking service allowed the client to sell their merchandise alongside the bookings, which was not possible before. This added revenue stream was an added benefit for the client and helped to improve their bottom line.`,
